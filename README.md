# 🛠️ Installation
> Please note that you need to strictly follow the steps: **Modify `mplib` Library Code** and **Download Assert**.

See [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) for installation instructions. It takes about 20 minutes for installation.


# 🧑🏻‍💻 Usage 
## 1. Task Running and Data Collection
Running the following command will first search for a random seed for the target collection quantity (default is 100), and then replay the seed to collect data.

```
bash run_task.sh ${task_name} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash run_task.sh block_hammer_beat 0
```

## 2. Task Config
> We strongly recommend you to see [Config Tutorial](./CONFIG_TUTORIAL.md) for more details.

Data collection configurations are located in the `config` folder, corresponding to each task. 

The most important setting is `head_camera_type` (default is `D435`), which directly affects the visual observation collected. This setting indicates the type of camera for the head camera, and it is aligned with the real machine. You can see its configuration in `task_config/_camera_config.yml`.

## 3. Deploy your policy
See `envs/base_task.py`, search `TODO` and you may see the following code, make sure that `policy.get_action(obs)` will return action sequence (predicted actions).:
```
actions = model.get_action(obs) # TODO, get actions according to your policy and current obs
```

You need to modify `script/eval_policy.py` in the root directory to load your model for evaluation: Search `TODO`, modify the code to init your policy. 

# 🚴‍♂️ Baselines
## 1. RDT
The RDT code can be found in `policy/RDT`.

See [RDT README](./policy/RDT/README.md) for more details.

## 2. Diffusion Policy
The DP code can be found in `policy/Diffusion-Policy`.

Process Data for DP training after collecting data (In root directory), and input the task name, head_camera_type and the amount of data you want your policy to train with (In fact, this step is not necessary; you can directly run the `train.sh` script. When there is no corresponding data detected, we will automatically perform this step):
```
python script/pkl2zarr_dp.py ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num}
# As example: python script/pkl2zarr_dp.py block_hammer_beat D435 100, which indicates preprocessing of 100 block_hammer_beat task trajectory data using D435 camera.
```

Then, move to `policy/Diffusion-Policy` first, and run the following code to train DP:
```
bash train.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash train.sh block_hammer_beat D435 100 0 0
```

Run the following code to evaluate DP for a specific task for 100 times:
```
bash eval.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${checkpoint_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash eval.sh block_hammer_beat D435 100 300 0 0
```

## 3. 3D Diffusion Policy
The DP3 code can be found in `policy/3D-Diffusion-Policy`.

Process Data for DP3 training after collecting data (In the root directory), and input the task name and the amount of data you want your policy to train with (In fact, this step is not necessary; you can directly run the `train.sh` script. When there is no corresponding data detected, we will automatically perform this step):
```
python script/pkl2zarr_dp3.py ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num}
# As example: python script/pkl2zarr_dp3.py block_hammer_beat D435 100
```

Then, move to `policy/3D-Diffusion-Policy` first, and run the following code to train DP3:
```
bash train.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash train.sh block_hammer_beat D435 100 0 0
# if use color: use `train_rgb.sh` instead
```

Run the following code to evaluate DP3 for a specific task:
```
bash eval.sh ${task_name} ${head_camera_type} ${expert_data_num} ${checkpoint_num} ${seed} ${gpu_id}
# As example: bash eval.sh block_hammer_beat D435 100 3000 0 0
# if use color: use `eval_rgb.sh` instead
```

# 🏄‍♂️ Experiment & LeaderBoard
For each task, we evaluated the baseline performance under two real-camera-aligned settings: L515 (320×180 resolution, FOV 45°) and D435 (320×240 resolution, FOV 37°). The tests were conducted using datasets of 20, 50, and 100 samples. For each experiment, the policy was trained using three random seeds (0, 1, 2, which were not cherry-picked). Each policy was then tested 100 times, yielding three success rates. The mean and standard deviation of these success rates were computed to obtain the experimental results presented below.

## Benchmark LeaderBoard
> Due to continuous updates in the benchmark, the current leaderboard results should be considered provisional. We will comprehensively re-evaluate and update the entire leaderboard in Version 2.0.

# ⁉️ Common Issues
If you find you fail to quit the running Python process with `Crtl + C`, just try `Ctrl + \`.

We found Vulkan is not stable in some off-screen devices, try reconnecting `ssh -X ...` if you meet any problem.

Other Common Issues can be found in [COMMON_ISSUE](./COMMON_ISSUE.md).

# ⏱️ Future Plans
1. Paper of RoboTwin (Final Version) will be released soon.
2. Real Robot Data collected by teleoperation.
3. More baseline code will be integrated into this repository (RICE, ACT, Diffusion Policy).

### Docker Setup

All of the examples in this repo provide instructions for being run normally, and also using Docker. Although not required, the Docker option is recommended as this will simplify software installation, produce a more stable environment, and also allow you to avoid installing ROS and cluttering your machine, for examples which depend on ROS.

Docker installation instructions are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). If using a GPU you must also install the [NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html). If your host machine is Ubuntu 22.04, you can use the convenience scripts `scripts/docker/install_docker_ubuntu22.sh` and `scripts/docker/install_nvidia_container_toolkit.sh`.

During the first run of any example, Docker will build the images. Go grab a coffee while this happens. Subsequent runs will be faster since the images are cached.
